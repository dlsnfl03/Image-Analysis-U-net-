# Image Analysis with U-Net

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the U-Net model for image object detection. The implementation was carried out on Google Colab, with training performed using the COCO dataset. Additionally, the trained model was tested on personal photographs to evaluate its real-world performance.
