# Image Analysis with U-Net

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the U-Net model for image object detection. The model was trained using the COCO dataset on Google Colab, leveraging its extensive library of annotated images for robust performance. Additionally, the trained model was tested on personal photographs to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
