# Image Analysis with U-Net

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the U-Net model for image object detection. The model was trained using the COCO dataset on Google Colab, leveraging its extensive library of annotated images for robust performance. Additionally, the trained model was tested on personal photographs to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Model Architecture**: U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture designed for fast and precise segmentation of images.
- **Training Dataset**: COCO dataset, known for its comprehensive and diverse collection of labeled images.
- **Real-World Testing**: The trained model was applied to personal photographs, providing insights into its generalization capabilities and real-world applicability.
- **Visualization**: Results include detailed visualizations of the model's performance, comparing predictions against the original images.
## main
 **COCO Dataset Predictions**: Demonstrates the model's ability to detect and segment objects in the training dataset.

## Visualizations
 **Personal Photos Analysis**: Showcases the model's adaptability by applying it to personal images, highlighting its performance beyond the training data.
